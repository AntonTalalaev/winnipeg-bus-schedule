# Winnipeg-transit app

The bus schedule search project, built with use of the [Winnipeg Transit Data API](https://api.winnipegtransit.com/). 

The app allow users to search for bus schedules by street name. A search term is entered into a text input and the search is executed once the user presses the enter key. The search will return a list of streets that match the search query. Clicking on any of the streets in the returned list will display the next buses, for each route, at all the stops on a the selected street.
